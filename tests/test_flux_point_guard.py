"""The flux-point invariant: the knob scqo governs must BE the bias that plays.

scqo's ``idle_flux`` reads and writes ``q.z.<flux_point>_offset``
(``quam_fields.get/set_idle_flux``), while every probe's ``initialize_qpu``
applies the ``"joint"`` point — ``joint_offset`` for qubits and
``decouple_offset`` for couplers. When a state file DECLARES a different point
the two silently address different numbers, and ``idle_flux`` becomes a knob the
hardware never sees.

That was live on 5Q4C until 2026-07-29: all five z lines declared
``"independent"`` while every run biased them at ``joint_offset``, so the arch
fits' AND the resonator flux map's accepted sweet spots were both inert. The
failure is silent by nature — the write succeeds, the state file changes, the
next run is simply unaffected — which is why it needs an explicit guard rather
than a convention.
