"""The flux-headroom invariant: a port must be able to EMIT what the tree declares.

The per-sweep helpers in ``probes/_flux_limits.py`` refuse ONE probe when it asks
for more volts than its port can put out. This is the other half — a whole-tree
audit run once by the scqo backend factory, so a config that cannot work is
reported completely and up front ("these three ports need amplified mode")
instead of one probe dying on the first one it happens to touch.

Every failure it catches is silent on hardware: the DAC clips, the fit still
converges, and the QM simulator shows nothing.

This is also the ONE place the ``const`` = rail/2 convention is enforced. The
per-sweep helpers deliberately do not, because an undersized ``const`` does not
clip anything — it only caps reach — and enforcing it there would refuse configs
that genuinely work today (the live 5Q4C couplers sit at 0.15 V).
