"""The QM parity-monitor shells' pure decisions (no QUA, no instrument).

Covers BOTH variants — continuous (`qubit_parity_switch_continuous`) and
discrete (`qubit_parity_switch_discrete`). Everything here is arithmetic the
shells own and the probes trust:

* ns -> QUA clock cycles for the fixed idle (4 ns clock, 16 ns floor);
* the depletion wait's precedence AND the fact that 0 survives the floor —
  "measured, needs no settle" is a real answer, and rounding it up to 16 ns
  would silently lengthen every shot;
* the shot/cycle period, which is the telegraph timebase: the neutral layer
  divides a per-sample switching probability by it, so a period that disagrees
  with what the program plays scales every reported rate linearly;
* the discrete pad math: cycle_period_ns - sequence, refused by name when
  negative, 0 when None/exact, snapped UP through the 16 ns floor otherwise.

The absence of a qubit reset is a property of the QUA probe modules, checked by
reading them — a QUA program cannot be built without an instrument-grade
config, and a probe that silently regained a `qubit.reset()` would be
undetectable in the data.
