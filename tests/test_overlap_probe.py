"""``qubit_spectroscopy_overlap``: the drive and the readout tone really do overlap.

On this backend "overlap" is the ABSENCE of something — the ``align()`` that sits
between the drive and the measurement in ``qubit_spectroscopy.py``. A missing
barrier leaves no trace anywhere except in the emitted QUA, and re-adding one
would silently turn the experiment back into its sequential sibling while every
fit still converged. So this reads the generated QUA program and asserts the
shape directly, with the sequential probe built alongside as the contrast.

Live-QUAM: the pre-tone plays a REAL ``readout`` operation through
``Channel.play``, and whether a ``BaseReadoutPulse`` can be played without being
measured is a property of the actual tree, not of a stub.
