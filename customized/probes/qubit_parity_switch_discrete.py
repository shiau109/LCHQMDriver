"""Discrete charge-parity monitor acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Per cycle: measure M1 - depletion wait - x90 - fixed idle - y90 - measure M2 -
pad wait, repeated as `num_shots` back-to-back cycles. M1 PROJECTS the qubit
(measurement-based initialization — the reason this probe carries no
`qubit.reset(...)` of any kind), the 90-degree-shifted pulse pair maps the
parity onto the pole, and M2 reads it: the parity of each cycle is the
WITHIN-CYCLE difference m1 XOR m2, so — unlike the continuous sibling — decay
during the pad wait corrupts no parity sample and the cycle may be padded
arbitrarily long (`tau_wait_cycles`, from scqo's `cycle_period_ns`).

BOTH measurements are recorded, into the SAME streams: two saves per cycle,
`buffer(2).buffer(num_shots)` and NO `.average()`, so each stream comes back
shaped (shot_idx, meas_idx) with meas_idx 0 = M1. Handle base names stay
digit-free (`state1`/`I1`/`Q1`), which is what lets the fetcher group them per
qubit.

Like the continuous probe, this does NOT call `qubit.readout_state()` in
discriminated mode: that helper ends with its own depletion wait, which would
double-count the governed wait and break the scheduled cycle period. The
threshold assign is inlined instead (the threshold still comes from the QUAM
readout operation, i.e. scqo's accepted `readout_threshold` knob).

`idle_cycles`, `depletion_cycles` and `tau_wait_cycles` are per-qubit-name
dicts of 4 ns clock cycles; the caller (the scqo shell) owns the ns->cycles
conversion, the cycle-period padding math and its too-short refusal.
