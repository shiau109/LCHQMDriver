"""Single-excitation flux-chevron acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) -
no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Adapted from `calibrations/19_chevron_11_02.py` (the two-qubit CZ chevron). The
flux pulse still sweeps amplitude x duration on the control qubit's z line and
both qubits are still read out, but only **one** qubit of the pair is excited with
`x180` (selected by `drive_role`, default the control qubit) instead of preparing
|11>. There is no fit/state-writeback downstream; the node renders a 2D color map.

With state discrimination both qubits are read out 2-level and the saved data is the
joint two-qubit populations P00, P01, P10, P11 (first digit = control, second =
target) as variables `state_gg/state_ge/state_eg/state_ee` -- not the independent
single-qubit averages. Without state discrimination the raw I/Q of each qubit is saved.

The sub-4ns flux-pulse granularity uses the baking tool (`qualang_tools.bakery`):
short segments (1..16 ns) are baked into the config, and longer pulses combine a
baked tail with a dynamically stretched (multiple-of-4ns) `play`.

Amplitude sweep (`amp_mode`), mirroring `customized.probes.pair_qcq_fixed_time`:
  - "prefactor" (default, what the qualibrate node uses): the sweep values are a
    unitless pre-factor on a base amplitude computed from QUAM as the |11>-|02>
    resonance point of each pair.
  - "absolute": the sweep values ARE the emitted flux-pulse amplitudes in volts.
    The QUAM |11>-|02> formula is not consulted at all (it is meaningless when the
    caller names volts, and a bring-up tree may not carry the fields it reads).

`flux_role` selects which qubit's z line carries the flux pulse; it defaults to
the control qubit, which is what this probe used to hardwire.

    Returns `(qua_amps, base_levels, denoms)`:
      - `qua_amps` is the array the single shared QUA loop iterates (the value the
        baked pulse's `amp_array` scales by);
      - `base_levels[pair]` is the level the 1..16 ns segments are baked at;
      - `denoms[pair]` is the stored amplitude of the z line's `const` operation,
        which the >16 ns `play` branch divides by.

    Both QUA branches emit `base_level * qua_amp` volts -- the baked branch scales
    the baked waveform directly, the play branch plays `const` at
    `(base_level/denom) * qua_amp`. That equality is the invariant every mode has
    to preserve, and it is what `tests/test_pair_swap_probes.py` pins.

    In "prefactor" mode `base_level` is the per-pair QUAM |11>-|02> amplitude and
    `qua_amps` is the sweep verbatim -- the same numbers this probe has always
    played, so the qualibrate node is unchanged (what is new there is that the
    degenerate cases refuse by name instead of by ZeroDivisionError). In
    "absolute" mode the sweep is volts: one
    reference `amp_ref = max|amplitudes|` becomes the baked level for every pair
    and `qua_amps = amplitudes / amp_ref`, so the emitted volts equal the swept
    value on both branches. The reference must be a SCALAR because
    `for_(*from_array(a, ...))` is one loop shared by every multiplexed pair;
    deriving it from the sweep also makes the stored waveform peak equal the
    sweep's own maximum, so the DAC-rail guard below becomes the physically
    meaningful one ("you asked to emit more than the rail can").

    Pure: no QUA, no config, no baking -- callable from a test with stub pairs.
