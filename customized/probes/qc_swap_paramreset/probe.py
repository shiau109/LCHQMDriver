"""Swap-based-reset circuit acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam/qualang_tools) -
no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Exercises a swap-based reset scheme. Each shot prepares an excitation on a chosen
`excite_qubit` (`x180`), then applies the circuit body R times: a SWAP on the
qubit pair followed by a RESET on an ancilla qubit. The number of rounds R is the swept
axis, so reading out a chosen set of qubits versus R shows how the population is removed
round by round (R=0 is the no-round baseline: just the x180 prep). One curve per measured
qubit.

The excited qubit is chosen independently of the swap pair: `excite_qubit` need not be the
swap pair's control qubit (it can be the target or any other qubit).

Circuit per shot (for a swept round count R):
  1. Initialize every involved qubit with `q.reset(reset_type, simulate)`
     (involved = measured qubits + `excite_qubit` + the swap pair's control/target + the
     reset qubit).
  2. State prep: `excite_qubit.xy.play("x180")`.
  3. Repeat R times: `swap_pair.macros[swap_operation].apply()` then
     `reset_qubit.macros[reset_operation].apply()`.
  4. Read out every measured qubit (state discrimination -> discriminated state, else raw I/Q).

The swap/reset macros are invoked **bare** (`.apply()` with no extra args), so the chosen
macros must be callable that way - their amplitudes/pulses baked into the QUAM macro
definition (e.g. like `CZImplementation`, whose `apply()` has all-default args). A macro
whose `apply()` has required positional args (e.g. the current `ISwapImplementation`,
which needs `ctrl_amp`/`cplr_amp`) needs a default-carrying variant before it can be used
here as `swap_operation`/`reset_operation`.

There is no fit/state-writeback downstream; the node renders a 1D population-vs-round curve.

    `measure_qubits` is a plain list of qubit objects read out at the end of the circuit;
    `excite_qubit` is the qubit object excited with `x180` for state prep (chosen
    independently of the swap pair);
    `swap_pair` is a qubit-pair object whose `macros[swap_operation]` is applied each round;
    `reset_qubit` is a qubit object whose `macros[reset_operation]` is applied each round.
    `rounds_array` is the integer sweep over the number of swap+reset rounds (R=0 allowed,
    giving just the x180 prep). All measured qubits are read out within the same shot
    (joint / multiplexed readout), since they share one circuit.

    `settle_ns` (multiple of 4, default 0) idles the swap pair's flux lines before each
    swap, so a preceding reset's flux pulse can settle before the swap fires.
    (For pure swap rounds with no reset, use the `qc_N_swap` node instead.)
