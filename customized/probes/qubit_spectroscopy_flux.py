"""Qubit-spectroscopy-vs-flux acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Sweep a flux bias and the drive frequency and read out each qubit; the qubit line is fitted
flux-by-flux downstream to give a frequency(flux) trace. Optional single flux / xy source qubits:
when `z_source_qubit` / `xy_source_qubit` are None every measured qubit fluxes / drives itself.

PULSE CONTRACT: `dcs` are VOLTS measured from the standing DC bias that
`initialize_qpu` applies -- the z `const` pulse rides on top of that offset, so
the axis is idle-relative and 0 V means "stay parked". `flux_point` is passed
EXPLICITLY (rather than leaning on quam_builder's "joint" default) because the
same value feeds the rail validation: the DAC emits idle + excursion, so the
number that was checked must be the number that plays.
