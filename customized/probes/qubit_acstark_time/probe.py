"""Time-dependent readout-resonator photon acquisition probe: vendor code only
(qm/quam/qualang_tools) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

AC-Stark / photon-number-vs-time measurement. A readout-resonator test pulse
populates the resonator; the qubit is then probed by a saturation/x180 pulse at a
swept delay after the test pulse, while the drive frequency is swept across the
qubit line. Locating the AC-Stark-shifted qubit line per delay traces the
resonator photon number filling up and ringing down in time.

The sweep is `detuning` x `delay_time`; the delay is stepped in clock cycles
(4 ns granularity). `delay_time` is the SIGNED probe delay relative to the
cavity-drive ONSET: positive = the qubit probe fires after the drive starts
(cavity filling / ring-down), negative = the probe fires *before* the drive. The
resonator drive is anchored at a fixed reference and only the probe moves; a common
non-negative `offset` lead is prepended to both elements so the most-negative delay
still yields a legal (>=4-cycle) wait, and because both elements share that lead the
probe lands *exactly* `delay_time` ns from the drive (the lead cancels between them).
Both qubits are read out as raw I/Q (state discrimination saves the discriminated
state instead). Downstream this is fit by scqat's `ReadoutPulsePhotonEstimator`,
which expects the `detuning`/`delay_time` coords (negative delays are fine).

Note: the qubit drive (`xy`) and its `resonator` must be on DIFFERENT QM cores/threads
for the probe to overlap the drive; same-core elements are serialized (the drive plays
to completion first).
