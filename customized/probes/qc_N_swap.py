"""N-swap (swap-chain) circuit acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam/qualang_tools) -
no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Exercises a coherent swap chain. Each shot prepares an excitation on the swap pair's
control qubit (`x180`), then applies a SWAP on the qubit pair N times. The number of
swaps N is the swept axis, so reading out a chosen set of qubits versus N shows the
population exchanged back and forth between the pair swap by swap (N=0 is the no-swap
baseline: just the x180 prep). One line per joint state of the measured set (000, 001,
...), or a per-qubit marginal when `multiplexed` is off.

Circuit per shot (for a swept swap count N):
  1. Initialize every involved qubit with `q.reset(reset_type, simulate)`
     (involved = measured qubits + the swap pair's control/target).
  2. State prep: `swap_pair.qubit_control.xy.play("x180")`.
  3. Repeat N times: `swap_pair.macros[swap_operation].apply()`, then idle the pair's
     flux lines for `operation_gap_ns` (if nonzero).
  4. Read out every measured qubit (state discrimination -> discriminated state, else raw I/Q).

The swap macro is invoked **bare** (`.apply()` with no extra args), so the chosen macro
must be callable that way - its amplitudes/pulses baked into the QUAM macro definition
(e.g. like `CZImplementation`, whose `apply()` has all-default args). A macro whose
`apply()` has required positional args (e.g. the current `ISwapImplementation`, which
needs `ctrl_amp`/`cplr_amp`) needs a default-carrying variant before it can be used here
as `swap_operation`.

With state discrimination the probe saves the **per-shot** discriminated states (var
`state`, dims `(qubit, shot, round)`) so the node can render the joint multi-qubit
populations (000, 001, ... one line per state vs N) or the per-qubit marginals; without it
the shot-averaged raw I/Q is saved instead. There is no fit and no state writeback.
