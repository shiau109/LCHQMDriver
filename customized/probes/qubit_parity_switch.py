"""Charge-parity monitor acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

y90 - fixed idle - x90 - measure, repeated as `num_shots` back-to-back single
shots. The 90-degree-SHIFTED second pulse measures sin of the parity-dependent
phase (+/- pi/2 at the intended idle), which is ODD in parity, so the two charge
parities land on opposite readout poles; a same-axis pair would measure the even
cos and see no parity at all.

Two deliberate absences, both load-bearing:

* **No `qubit.reset(...)`.** Between shots only the RESONATOR is waited out
  (its depletion time). The sequence re-prepares the equator every shot
  regardless of the starting pole, and the shot cadence IS the telegraph
  timebase the switching rate is fitted against — a thermal wait would stretch
  it by orders of magnitude and scale every reported rate with it.
* **No `.average()` in the stream processing.** Every shot is its own sample of
  the telegraph; averaging them is exactly the information being measured.
  (The legacy `calibrations/exclude/LCH_parity_switch_ramsey.py` node carried a
  `.buffer(n).average()` that was a no-op only because a single buffer was ever
  produced.)

`idle_cycles` and `depletion_cycles` are per-qubit-name dicts of 4 ns clock
cycles; the caller (the scqo shell) owns the ns->cycles conversion and the
precedence between a per-run override and the standing QUAM value.

WHY THIS DOES NOT CALL `qubit.readout_state()` in discriminated mode, unlike
every other per-shot probe here: that helper ENDS with its own
`wait(resonator.depletion_time // 4)`. On top of this program's own
between-shot wait that is two depletion waits per shot — the cadence, and
therefore every reported rate, off by the difference — and it would also make
the per-run `readout_depletion_ns` override apply to only one of them. The
threshold assign is three lines of the same vendor API, so the wait keeps
exactly one owner. (The threshold itself still comes from the QUAM readout
operation, i.e. scqo's accepted `readout_threshold` knob.)
