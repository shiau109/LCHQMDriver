"""Concurrent-tone qubit-spectroscopy acquisition probe: vendor code only
(qm/quam) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

Two-tone spectroscopy with the saturation drive and the readout tone playing
TOGETHER, and the acquisition opening only after both have been on a while:

    t = 0                                     acq_lead_ns
     |                                             |
     v                                             v
     ############## readout tone ###########################
     [========= saturation drive =========]
                                           [==== ADC ====]

WHAT MAKES THE TONES OVERLAP: there is NO `align()` between the qubit drive and
the measurement. Both element timelines start from the one shared `align()`
above them, and neither is given a `wait`, so the drive and the readout tone go
up on the same edge. (`qubit_spectroscopy.py`, the sequential sibling, has an
`align()` right there, which is the entire difference between the two probes.)

WHAT MAKES THE ADC OPEN LATE: QUAM's `measure()` takes no acquisition-delay
argument - the ADC follows its own pulse by `resonator.time_of_flight` and
nothing else - so the lead is a PRE-TONE instead. The same readout operation is
played for `acq_lead_ns` immediately before `measure()`, contiguous on the
resonator's timeline, so the resonator sees one seamless tone of
`acq_lead_ns + readout_len` and the ADC integrates only its tail. `time_of_flight`
is untouched: it is the cable, not the lead.

NOTE (a SILENT failure): the qubit drive (`xy`) and its `resonator` must be on
DIFFERENT QM cores/threads for the tones to overlap at all. Same-core elements
are SERIALIZED - the drive plays to completion first, you get the sequential
experiment back, and the fit still converges and looks clean. Check the analog
traces in the OPX simulator before trusting a result from a new wiring, and if
they are serialized, repartition the FEM rather than working around it here.

Times are given in ns and must be multiples of 4 (the QUA clock cycle); scqo's
`experiments/_overlap.py` is what guarantees that on the scqo path.
