"""Resonator-spectroscopy-vs-power acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) -
no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

2-D resonator spectroscopy vs readout power: per readout-amplitude point, repeat a
fast sweep of the readout intermediate frequency around each resonator's current IF.
The |IQ| dip locates the resonance at every power. No qubit reset - the resonator is
measured directly.

Loop order (2026-07-14, user-decided; both scqo backends match): amplitude (outer)
-> averages (middle) -> frequency (INNER = fastest) — each power point repeats the
frequency sweep ``num_shots`` times, so the resonator only jumps power between the
slow outer steps. The acquired axis order is therefore (power, detuning). The caller
must have set each resonator's base output power to the sweep's max power *before*
generating the config (the qualibrate shell does this via ``tracked_updates``); this
probe only builds the amplitude/frequency sweep, keeping it framework-free.

``depletion_time_ns`` optionally overrides every resonator's configured
``depletion_time`` for the between-readout ring-down wait (None keeps the per-qubit
QUAM values) — it also covers the wrap-around high->low amplitude jump between
repetitions of the inner sweep.
