"""Unidirectional-coupling visualization: a single combined population-vs-round figure.

With state discrimination and `multiplexed` on, the joint multi-qubit populations
(000, 001, ... 111) are plotted on one figure; with `multiplexed` off, each measured
qubit's independent P(excited) is plotted on one figure. Without state discrimination the
raw I quadrature of each qubit is shown instead. The population math + plot live in the
shared `customized.node._qc_populations` helper.
