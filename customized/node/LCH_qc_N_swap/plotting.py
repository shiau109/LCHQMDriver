"""N-swap (swap-chain) visualization: a single combined population-vs-N figure.

With state discrimination and `multiplexed` on, the joint multi-qubit populations
(000, 001, ... 111) are plotted on one figure, one line per state versus the number of
swaps N; with `multiplexed` off, each measured qubit's independent P(excited) is plotted
instead. Without state discrimination the raw I quadrature of each qubit is shown. The
population math + plot live in the shared `customized.node._qc_populations` helper.
