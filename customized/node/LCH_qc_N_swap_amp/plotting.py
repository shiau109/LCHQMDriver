"""N-swap x qubit-flux-amplitude visualization: a grid of 2D color maps.

With state discrimination and `multiplexed` on, one 2D color map is drawn per joint
multi-qubit state (000, 001, ... 111): population vs the number of swaps N (x) and the
swept ctrl flux amplitude (y), on a shared 0-1 color scale. With `multiplexed` off, one map
is drawn per measured qubit's P(excited); without state discrimination, one map per qubit's
raw I. The population math + plot live in the shared `customized.node._qc_populations`
helper.
