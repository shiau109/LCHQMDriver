"""QM concurrent-tone qubit spectroscopy for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, peak fitting and the drive_freq_hz writeback are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitSpectroscopyOverlap``; the sequence is
``customized/probes/qubit_spectroscopy_overlap.py`` (read its docstring - it
carries the FEM-core caveat that decides whether the tones really overlap).
scqo sweeps ``detuning_hz``; the probe builds the same sweep on coord
``detuning``, which the backend's ``_to_canonical`` renames back.

The timing is NOT computed here. ``scqo.experiments._overlap.overlap_windows``
resolves the tone length, the ADC lead and the drive length from the readout
channel's own knobs and refuses off-grid values, so this shell and the Qblox
probe cannot drift apart on what the same Parameters mean.

Drive power contract: unchanged from the sequential probe - the core ``run()``
already solved the drive chain for ``drive_power_dbm`` (recorded set -> acquire
-> revert), parking the exact amplitude on the saturation op, so the probe plays
it at ``amplitude_scale=1.0`` (exact in QUA fixed point).
