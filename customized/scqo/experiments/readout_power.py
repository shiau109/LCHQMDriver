"""QM readout-power (fidelity vs readout amplitude) for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the per-amplitude two-Gaussian-mixture fit and the ``readout_amp``
writeback are inherited from ``scqo.experiments.ReadoutPower``. PER-SHOT
contract: every readout shot's I/Q point is recorded individually — the probe's
streams are ``buffer(2).buffer(len(amps)).buffer(num_shots)`` with NO
``.average()``. The swept ``amp_prefactor`` values are applied as QUA
``amplitude_scale`` on the readout pulse (prefactor x current readout_amp).

AXIS-ORDER NOTE: the probe's QUA loops nest shot (outer) over amplitude over
prepared-state (inner), so the raw per-qubit array is shaped
(shot_idx, amp_prefactor, prepared_state) — a permutation of scqo's declared
sweep order (amp_prefactor, prepared_state, shot_idx). The probe's sweep_axes
already carry exactly the canonical names ``shot_idx``/``amp_prefactor``/
``prepared_state`` in that raw nesting order, so the backend's ``_to_canonical``
takes its name-based path (no positional rename — which would scramble the axes)
and ``estimate()`` transposes by name.

SHOT-INDEX VALUES NOTE: the probe's ``shot_idx`` coord is ``arange(1, n+1)``
while scqo declares ``arange(n)``. This offset is acceptable: the name-based
``_to_canonical`` path asserts SIZES, not values, and ``estimate()`` uses the
coord only for transposing/slicing, never its numeric values (same situation as
the single_shot_readout / readout_fidelity pair).
