"""QM three-state single-shot readout for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the three-Gaussian-mixture fit and reporting are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.SingleShotReadoutGEF``. Same PER-SHOT contract as the
two-state probe (streams ``buffer(3).buffer(num_shots)``, no ``.average()``)
and the same axis-order note: the QUA loops nest the shot loop OUTER over the
prepared-state loop, so the raw array is (shot_idx, prepared_state) and the
backend's name-based ``_to_canonical`` path handles it.

Preparing |f> needs a calibrated EF pi pulse — the QUAM operation ``EF_x180``
on the qubit's xy channel — and the qubit's ``anharmonicity``, which is how far
below f_01 that pulse plays. Both are refused BY NAME here rather than
compiling a program that silently prepares |e> three times: the fit would find
two blobs, the third weight would collapse and the failure would look like a
readout problem instead of a missing calibration. Calibrate them with the
vendored ``12_Qubit_Spectroscopy_E_to_F`` and ``13_power_rabi_ef`` nodes.

No ``update()`` override: unlike the two-state experiment this proposes no
discriminator, because a scalar threshold on one rotated quadrature cannot
separate three blobs.
