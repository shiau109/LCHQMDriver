"""QM ramsey cryoscope for scqo — supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the step-response estimator and the paired-fact writeback are
inherited from ``scqo.experiments.QubitRamseyCryoscope``. scqo sweeps the flux-pulse
DURATION (``duration_ns``, every ns) x the closing-pulse FRAME (turns); the LCHQM
probe realizes the 1 ns duration resolution with baking (<=16 ns baked, a
stretched ``const`` plus a baked remainder above) and plays the flux pulse
idle-relative at the governed flux point.

Like the swap chevron, ``probe()`` ACQUIRES and returns a ready ``xr.Dataset``:
the program only runs against the probe's own baked config (which carries the
``flux_pulse1..16`` operations), and the backend's shared fetch path would
regenerate a config without them. The probe's ``sweep_axes`` are already the
canonical scqo names in raw nesting order (``duration_ns`` outer, ``frame``
inner), so ``_to_canonical`` takes its name-based path.

Single target: the probe refuses more than one qubit (the sequence is built per
qubit); reset is resolved through ``_reset.reset_type`` so ``reset_method
="active"`` is refused by name rather than silently thermalized.
