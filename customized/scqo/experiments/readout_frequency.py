"""QM readout-frequency (fidelity vs readout detuning) for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the per-frequency two-Gaussian-mixture fit and the ``readout_freq``
writeback are inherited from ``scqo.experiments.ReadoutFrequency``. PER-SHOT
contract: every readout shot's I/Q point is recorded individually — the probe's
streams are ``buffer(2).buffer(len(dfs)).buffer(num_shots)`` with NO
``.average()``. scqo sweeps ``detuning_hz``; the LCHQM probe applies each value
relative to the resonator's current IF (``df + intermediate_frequency`` — same
convention as the resonator_spectroscopy wrapper) but names its axis
``frequency``, which we re-key below.

AXIS-ORDER NOTE (do not "fix" the order below): the probe's QUA loops nest shot
(outer) over detuning over prepared-state (inner), so the raw per-qubit array is
shaped (shot_idx, frequency, prepared_state) — a permutation of scqo's declared
sweep order (detuning_hz, prepared_state, shot_idx). We re-key the probe's
sweep_axes with the canonical scqo names IN RAW NESTING ORDER (only ``frequency``
-> ``detuning_hz`` actually changes; the values already ARE the detunings), so
the backend's ``_to_canonical`` takes its name-based path (per-name size checks,
no positional rename — which would scramble the axes) and ``estimate()``
transposes by name.

SHOT-INDEX VALUES NOTE: the probe's ``shot_idx`` coord is ``arange(1, n+1)``
while scqo declares ``arange(n)``. This offset is acceptable: the name-based
``_to_canonical`` path asserts SIZES, not values, and ``estimate()`` uses the
coord only for transposing/slicing, never its numeric values (same situation as
the single_shot_readout / readout_fidelity pair).
