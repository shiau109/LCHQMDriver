"""QM single-excitation swap chevron for scqo — supplies ``probe()``.

Parameters, the record-only map summary and the (absent) writeback are
inherited from ``scqo.experiments.PairSwapChevron``; the joint-population
reduction comes from :class:`JointPopulationMixin`. scqo sweeps
``(flux_amp_v, swap_time_ns)`` in absolute volts and whole nanoseconds; the
LCHQM probe sweeps a QUA amplitude scale x a 1 ns-granular pulse duration
(baked below 4 ns), so this adapter drives the probe in its ``amp_mode
="absolute"`` mode and maps the neutral high/low roles onto the vendor's
control/target.

Unlike every other QM adapter here, ``probe()`` ACQUIRES and returns a ready
``xr.Dataset``: the program only runs against the probe's own baked config
(which carries the ``flux_pulse1..16`` operations), and the backend's shared
fetch path would regenerate a config without them.
