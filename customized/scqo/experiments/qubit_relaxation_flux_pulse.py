"""QM qubit relaxation vs flux PULSE (T1 spectrum) for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, fit, and reporting are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitRelaxationFluxPulse``.

PULSE CONTRACT: this probe conforms to the ``_pulse`` name by construction - the
z bias is a ``const`` PULSE played during the idle delay
(``customized/probes/qubit_relaxation_flux.py``), which the DAC adds to the
standing offset ``initialize_qpu`` applies, so ``flux_bias_v`` is an excursion
FROM ``idle_flux`` and 0 V means "stay parked". ``flux_point`` is passed
explicitly for the reason the probe documents: the bias that was rail-validated
must be the bias that plays. The probe MODULE keeps its historical name (it is
shared with the qualibrate ``LCH_T1_spectrum`` shell).
