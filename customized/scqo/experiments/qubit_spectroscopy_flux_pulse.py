"""QM qubit spectroscopy vs PULSED flux for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the transmon-arch fit and reporting are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitSpectroscopyFluxPulse``. scqo sweeps ``(flux_bias_v,
detuning_hz)``; the LCHQM probe sweeps ``dcs`` (flux, V) and ``dfs`` (drive
detuning, Hz) with each qubit fluxing/driving its OWN lines (z/xy source = None,
as in the official 03b node).

PULSE CONTRACT: this probe conforms to the ``_pulse`` name by construction — the
flux is a z PULSE played only alongside the saturation drive
(``customized/probes/qubit_spectroscopy_flux.py``: ``qubit.z.play(...,
duration=operation_duration)`` then ``align()`` then ``measure``), so every
readout happens at idle flux and the neutral ``estimate()`` reduces the map
against ONE global IQ reference. The DAC adds that pulse to the standing offset
``initialize_qpu`` applies, which is what makes ``flux_bias_v`` an excursion FROM
``idle_flux`` (0 V = stay parked) and why the neutral ``estimate()``
re-references the fitted sweet spot to an absolute set-point before writing
``flux_offset``. ``flux_point`` is passed explicitly so the bias the probe
rail-validated is the bias that plays. The probe MODULE keeps its historical name
(it is shared with the qualibrate shell path).

AXIS-ORDER NOTE (do not "fix" the order below): the probe's QUA loops nest df
(outer) over dc (inner) and its streams are ``buffer(len(dcs)).buffer(len(dfs))``,
so the raw per-qubit array is shaped (detuning, flux) — the OPPOSITE of scqo's
declared sweep order (flux_bias_v, detuning_hz). A positional rename in
``_to_canonical`` would therefore swap the axes (silently, whenever the two sweep
lengths happen to be equal). Instead we re-key the probe's sweep_axes with the
canonical scqo names IN RAW NESTING ORDER; ``_to_canonical`` then takes its
name-based path (no rename, per-name size checks) and ``estimate()`` transposes
by name.
