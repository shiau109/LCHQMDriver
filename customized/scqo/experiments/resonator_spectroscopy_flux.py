"""QM resonator spectroscopy vs flux for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the dispersive-model fit and reporting are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.ResonatorSpectroscopyFlux``. scqo sweeps ``(flux_bias_v,
detuning_hz)``; the LCHQM probe sweeps ``dcs`` (flux, V) and ``dfs`` (readout
detuning, Hz, relative to each resonator's current IF — same convention as the
resonator_spectroscopy wrapper) with each qubit fluxing its OWN z line
(z_source=None, as in the official 02c node).

AXIS-ORDER NOTE (do not "simplify" the re-key below): the probe's QUA loops nest
dc (outer) over df (inner) and its streams are
``buffer(num_shots).map(average()).buffer(len(dfs)).buffer(len(dcs))``, so the raw
per-qubit array is shaped (flux, detuning) — which for THIS probe happens to match
scqo's declared sweep order (flux_bias_v, detuning_hz). We still re-key the
probe's sweep_axes with the canonical scqo names IN RAW NESTING ORDER so the
backend's ``_to_canonical`` takes its name-based path (per-name size checks, no
rename): a positional rename would silently swap equal-sized axes if either
nesting ever changed, while the name-based path stays correct because
``estimate()`` transposes by name.
