"""QM residual-population measurement for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the pinned-center fit and the ``n_th`` writeback are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitThermalPopulation``. The program is the readout-fidelity
one with a single prepared state: reset, measure, repeat — no drive pulse at all,
so the cloud is whatever the passive wait leaves behind.

Same PER-SHOT contract and axis-order note as ``single_shot_readout``; the
streams are ``buffer(1).buffer(num_shots)`` and the length-1 prepared_state axis
is kept so the dataset shape matches the rest of the family.
