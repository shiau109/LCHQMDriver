"""QM resonator spectroscopy vs ABSOLUTE power (amplitude sweep) for scqo - supplies
only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the punchout analysis and the readout_power_dbm/readout_freq_hz writeback
are inherited from ``scqo.experiments.ResonatorSpectroscopyPowerAmp``. scqo sweeps
``(power_dbm, detuning_hz)``; the LCHQM probe builds the same sweep on coords
``(power, detuning)``, which the backend's ``_to_canonical`` renames positionally.

Power convention: the core ``run()`` already solved the chain for the window top
(``readout_power_dbm = max_power_dbm``), so the probe's ``amps`` prefactors are
relative to THAT top — ``10**((power_dbm - max_power_dbm)/20)``, top point exactly
1.0 (``amplitude_scale`` scales the readout pulse the setter just parked at ~0.5 of
full scale; every prefactor is <= 1, well inside QUA's range). Same realization as
the qualibrate ``LCH_resonator_spectroscopy_power`` node (set-top -> sweep down ->
revert), whose shared probe module is reused unchanged. Loop order is amplitude ->
averages -> frequency (the probe's contract); the ring-down wait is the governed
depletion time — the per-run ``readout_depletion_ns`` override, else the readout
channel's calibrated ``readout_depletion_s`` knob, which on this backend IS the
resonators' ``depletion_time`` (None = never calibrated, keep the QUAM values).
