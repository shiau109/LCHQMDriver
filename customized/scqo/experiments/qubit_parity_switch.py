"""QM charge-parity monitor for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the REFUSE gates (a stored ``parity_delta_f_hz`` for the fixed
idle, a governed depletion wait for the shot cadence, stored blob centers for
the trace discrimination), the telegraph-PSD fit and the ``parity_rate_hz``
writeback are all inherited from ``scqo.experiments.QubitParitySwitch``. This
class only converts the resolved ns values into QUA clock cycles and reports
the scheduled shot period back to the neutral layer.

PER-SHOT contract: every shot is recorded individually — the probe's streams
are ``buffer(num_shots)`` with NO ``.average()``.

NOT MULTIPLEXED, on purpose. Each qubit gets its own batch, so its shot cadence
is its own; in a multiplexed batch the ``align()``s tie every qubit's period to
the slowest member, and that period is exactly what each qubit's switching rate
is divided by.
