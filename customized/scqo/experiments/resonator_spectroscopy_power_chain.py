"""QM chain-stepped absolute punchout for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the per-point chain-stepping run lifecycle (python loop: re-solve
full_scale_power_dbm + amplitude per power point, one 1D acquisition each,
boundary-recorded set/revert), the punchout analysis and the
readout_power_dbm/readout_freq proposals are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.ResonatorSpectroscopyPowerChain``.

By the time ``probe()`` runs, the core loop has already pushed THIS point's chain
into QUAM (and the shared acquire regenerates the QUA config every cycle), so the
probe is literally the plain 1D resonator-spectroscopy program measured at the
current readout amplitude (~0.5 full scale) — ``customized/probes/
resonator_spectroscopy.build_program`` is reused UNCHANGED, including its
``rr.wait(depletion_time)`` between shots. ``self.sweep_axes`` holds only the
detuning axis during each per-point call (the run loop swaps it in).
